         • Originally this statue was LuaTastic's avatar.<br/>
         • The statue has a name floating above it in-game, implying that it's an npc and that it's sentient in some way.<br/>
         • The statue can also be damaged, but killing it does nothing.<br/>
         • The statue is placed on some sort of stand, with a malfunctioning mainframe computer on the front. If you try to operate the computer, it
         will damage you.<br/>
