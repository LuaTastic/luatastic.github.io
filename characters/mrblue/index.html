         • Mr. Blue is pretty intelligent and has good memory, because he can count money without a cash register and memorise his products' prices.<br/>
         • "Mr. Blue" is only a pseudonym. He has a real name, starting on S. He prefers to keep his name secret, and there is only 1 person that knows his actual name.<br/>
         • Mr. Blue can speak and write in fluent Russian, though he never does in T.P.R.<br/>
         • Mr. Blue has a friendly personality. He loves making new friends.<br/>
         • He sleeps in the store at night, instead of going home, but the reason for this is unknown.<br/>
         • Mr. Blue has an odd memory about some purple-shirt individual, which was, supposedly, his friend once.<br/>
